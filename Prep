Probability/Statistics
We expect that you will understand fundamental concepts in statistics. These may include measures of central tendency, error metrics, 
and least squares regression. You will leverage your experience in solving probability problems, including those related to combinations 
and permutations. You may be asked to apply conditional probability, including the law of total probability and Bayes theorem.You will 
have a basic working knowledge of the Binomial and Poisson distributions. Your TAO may ask you to interpret plots, such as histograms, 
boxplots, and other distribution visualizations.
